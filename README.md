# My Python Journey

Welcome to **My Python Journey** repository! This is where I document my daily learning progress in Python as I work towards mastering this versatile programming language. Whether you're a beginner, an intermediate learner, or an experienced developer, I hope you find something useful or inspiring in my journey.

## Overview

### Why Python?
Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and vast libraries, making it an ideal language for various applications, including web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and more. My goal is to reach an intermediate level of proficiency by following a structured 30-day roadmap and beyond.

### Learning Objectives
- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.
- Explore advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and data structures.
- Apply Python in real-world scenarios, including data analysis and automation.
- Document my progress, challenges, and learnings daily.

## Daily Progress

This section will be updated daily with a brief summary of what I learned each day, along with any code snippets or examples I worked on.

| Day | Date       | Topic/Concept Covered                          | Link to Code         |
|-----|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1   | 2024-09-02 | First Python Program; Hello world              | [Day 1 Code](day1_intro.py) |
| 2   | 2024-09-03 | Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators| [Day 2 Code](day2_variables_datatypes.py) |
| 3   | 2024-09-04 | Arithmetic Operations & String Concatenation   |[Day 3 Code](day3_arithmetic_operations.py) |
| 4   | 2024-09-05 | Handling user inputs                           |[Day 4 Code](day4_user_input.py) |

## How I Handle My Python Files

To keep my learning journey organized and easily navigable, Iâ€™ve decided on the following approach for handling Python files:

### File Structure
- **One Python File per Day**: Each day's learning will be documented in a separate Python file (e.g., `day1_basics.py`, `day2_loops.py`). This keeps the content focused and easy to reference.
- **Topic-Specific Folders**: As I dive into more complex topics, I might create folders to group related files (e.g., `OOP`, `Data_Structures`, `Web_Development`).
- **README Updates**: Every day, I will update this README file with a brief summary of what I learned and provide a link to the corresponding Python file.
